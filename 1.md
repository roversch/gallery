[Jackson Pollock, Summertime: Number 9A](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/pollock-summertime-number-9a-t03977) | [Heitor Villa-Lobos, Bachianas Brasileiras No. 1](https://open.spotify.com/album/1qvQRtKPtMIkvbvMtVqeMN?si=IUk_a5jsTMeY_ylvFshPYg)

The hip-swinging Bachianas Brasileiras by Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos leaves even the most stiff upper lips wondering if they ever had enough fun in their lives. Like a jaguar prowling on the loose, it lurks underneath the jungle canopy only to jumpscare you at their convenience. As people were wondering how to beat Bach even more to death, Villa-Lobos manages to grasp the audience with a whirlwind of clever references to both the German master and South American art forms. The 'Embolada', subject of the first movement of the first Bachiana Brasileira, is a contest between two improvising singers accompanying themselves by the pandeiro, a cousin of the European tambourine. These rap battles avant la lettre shine through also in the third movement, a classical fugue with a modern twist, where each of the parts have to claim their fair share of spotlight while sticking to the rules of the contest. The middle movement is a lament, reminiscent of the slow movement in Bach's violin concerto in A minor.

Compare the 'Bachianas' to Summertime by Jackson Pollock. The large 'drip painted' work is overwhelming at first, but by focusing on parts of it, you appreciate the extatic nature of it. Everywhere you look, you see dancing figures held together by the primary colors. Pollock suggests that song and dance are the original art forms, and blends these tribal feelings perfectly with a mid-20th century grey aesthetic. By looking closely, you can make out Villa-Lobos' jungle scenery by some sparse green splashes in the background. Both art works are incredibly energizing as a tribute (and a declaration of indebtedness?) to 'folk' and their major influence on 'high' art.
