[Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Ancient intersection of the Via Appia Antica and Via Ardeatina](https://sbirky.ngprague.cz/dielo/CZE:NG.R_162555) | [Philipp Glass, Einstein on the Beach, Act I Scene I: Train](https://open.spotify.com/track/2ga5HWiAHUon3G6hW03zZJ?si=lvoGst81RDOU-tdhogIokA)

A dense mechanical feat like a V8 motor block. Among this packed ensemble in Giovanni Battista Piranesi's 'Via Appia', you almost miss some major human achievements, both historic and fictional. The main pyramid of Gizeh at the horizon, the tower of Babylon towards the left, Romulus and Remus at the top left, some nods to oriental architecture and Greek poetry. Yet the full picture leaves a gnawing feeling. Standing on the shoulders of giants, yes, but are we not merely splattered by those same giants? As a partial answer, Piranesi does away with nostalgia, he carefully places wrought, overgrown branches attracting the wandering eye. A comment on the decadence of the old masters?

Similarly pressing and rolling, huffing and puffing is Philipp Glass' steam engine that crushes the listener in the first part of Einstein on the Beach. Although later parts of the opera seem light and trandescending, the very beginning does not allow for a breather. Heavy sax sounds and a packed choir make for an intense yet enjoyable ride through a fantastic landscape. Speaking of choir, the nonsense lyrics acknowledge the impossibility of reasoning amidst all of this mechanical violence. Then, in the middle of it, the motor is switched off. However, the momentum is kept and we thunder on until the main pistons join us once again. Michael Riesman's rendition is the reference for this work, with Glass himself on keyboard.
