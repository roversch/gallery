[Fernand Khnopff, Caresses](https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/nl/de-collectie/fernand-khnopff-liefkozingen) | [Erik Satie, Gnossiennes](https://open.spotify.com/album/1cLRjf5m6cTcqaFljda0r1?si=qnIiGdNzRK-FF-zZA93Nhw)

Perched against a mediterranean backdrop, a cheetah-woman is blissfully adoring her companion. He, uneasy but playing confident, wears Mercurius' staff as a sign of fleeting romance, a life on the road full of short bursts of intense emotions. She on the other hand is a romantic, and is settling already. However, look again: with her cat-like shrewdness, Khnopff is suggesting that this is a false naivet&eacute;: they complement each other. The passionate pair is balanced against a strangely solemn d&eacute;cor reminiscient of Salvador Dal&iacute;'s Bolivian desert. 

Or maybe Knossos, the subject of Erik Satie's Gnossiennes, could have been the site of the painting. With this six part suite of calmly breathing piano pieces, along with his even more famous Gymnop&eacute;dies, Satie initiated a minimalist movement. Almost hundred fifty years later, we find elements of Satie's original ideas in a wide swathe of the musical universe, from lo-fi hiphop to cheap sentimental Hollywood scores. Make no mistake: nobody pairs the seemingly relaxing rhythms with abrupt chord changes better than Satie. The Gnossiennes are devoid of any stereotypical orientalism, contrary to the contemporary fashion. Even so, he manages to evoke a land of wonder, where St&eacute;phane Mallarm&eacute;'s poetry would not have been out of place.
