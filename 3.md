[Damien Hirst, Beautiful like a torn iris](http://damienhirst.com/beautiful-like-a-torn-iris-pai) | [Aram Khachaturian, Concerto for Violin and Orchestra, 2nd movement](https://open.spotify.com/track/5UqEjmkYYpEFoK1bWEiiIN?si=IONOiQ0LQkym_x7C3wwRjA)

At first hearing, the second movement of Khachaturian's violin concerto (Andante sostenuto) seems ill-conceived. The beginning is going nowhere fast and listeners might ask themselves if the orchestra is playing with or against the soloist. Listen again, though, and it becomes apparent that each new phrase is to circle around the previous one. It creates a natural, powerful drive visiting faux-oriental ornaments before climaxing in a powerful dissonant passage. After the midpoint, circling back to the harmonies of the beginning, the piece ends in an unnerving atmosphere, ironically announcing the much livelier Allegro vivace. Oistrakh's rendition under the baton of Khachaturian himself is brittle and full of unspoken emotions.

Damien Hirst's lesser known spin paintings are physically reminiscent of the structure of the Khachaturian slow movement. Particularly striking is 'Beautiful like a torn iris' from 2003. Done in primary colors harking back to the techno-optimist era of the last century, it evokes the imperfect, always off-center nature of man interacting with machine. Just like the Andante consists of interlocking circles and spirals (two major ones and a number of smaller ones), the spin painting refers to itself more than once. In contrast, a circle-breaking golden sun is bringing a broad streak of euphoria, parallel to a brief D Major arpeggio near the end of the piece. After all is said and done, the painting seems excited, the Andante remains in hesitance.
